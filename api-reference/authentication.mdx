## Bearer Token

When requesting resources, you will need your Firmable key â€” you will find it in the [Dashboard](https://app.firmable.com/dashboard/profile?selected=integrations&connection=api). Here's how to add the key to the request header using cURL:

```bash
curl https://api.firmable.com/company/... \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fbl_xxx"
```

Always keep your root safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
